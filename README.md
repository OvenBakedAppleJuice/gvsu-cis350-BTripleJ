Project description (~1 Paragraph)
Audio-Responsive LED Display
Create a system where the Arduino Uno controls a strip of LEDs that respond to real-time audio input. A Python script will capture sound from a microphone and analyze the volume (amplitude) or pitch (frequency), then send that data over serial to the Arduino, which will adjust the LED brightness, color, or pattern accordingly.
