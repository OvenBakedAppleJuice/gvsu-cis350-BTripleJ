Team name: The Text Editors

Team members: Gab Borja, Cardell Taylor, John Le, Charlie Monteresso

# Introduction

Our project will be a text editor similar to that of Notepad or Google Docs that allows users to create, edit, and save text documents. The application will have all the fundamental text manipulation features found in other text editors. It will be designed mostly for casual writers who need a simple and easy to use text editor.

The editor will include formatting options, basic file management features, and customizable themes for a more personal user experience. Additional features may include real time collaboration or searching capabilities. The primary goal is to create an efficient and easy to use text editor that can be easily pulled up and used for tasks like note taking.

**Features**
- Basic text editing (cut, copy, paste, undo, redo)
- Formatting options (bold, italic, underline, font size)
- File operations (create, open, save, export)
- Theme customization

# Anticipated Technologies

Technologies that may be needed for this project include:

## Front End
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Backend
- Python
- Flask or Electron framework

# Method/Approach

Our approach will be to create a minimum viable product and add additional features afterwards. We will be using Trello to manage and assign tasks, using an Agile development process. 

Some steps include:

1. Research and Planning - Define the key features and scope and finalize the technology stack
2. UI/UX Design - Design the interface using Figma
3. Frontend Development - Create the text editor's main interface and interactive elements
4. Backend Development - Implement file management features and formatting options
5. Integration and Testing - Connect the frontend and backend and test for bugs
6. Deployment and Updates - Deploy the application, gather user feedback, and improve features

# Estimated Timeline

- Week 1-2: Planning, UI/UX Design
- Week 3-4: Frontend Development (Interface, Interactive Elements)
- Week 5-6: Backend Development (File management, Formatting)
- Week 7-8: Integrating, Testing, Debugging
- Week 9: Deployment and Final Adjusments

# Anticipated Problems

- Problems in implementing the GUI
- Possible issues with tracking version control
