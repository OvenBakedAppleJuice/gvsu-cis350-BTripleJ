# 1 Abstract
Writing is an essential part of everyday life, whether for work, school, or personal projects. However, finding a simple, efficient, and user-friendly text editor that meets individual needs can be challenging. Many existing editors are either too complex, lack necessary features, or fail to provide an intuitive experience. Our text editor "Jotter" aims to develop a text editor that balances functionality and ease of use, providing users with a seamless writing experience. The editor will offer essential text editing features, such as formatting, saving, and loading documents. By creating an intuitive and accessible tool, our goal is to streamline the writing process and enhance productivity for users across various domains.
