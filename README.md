Project description (~1 Paragraph)

# Description:
Streaming and processing audio data can be a challenge. We have an example script were starting from, but even so it will be difficult. It will require the use of the numpy library to make processing efficient as everything must happen in real time. 
Sending serial data to the arduino will be tricky as any data can be easily converted to bytes on the python side, but on the arduino side it will have to be unpacked and put together so the data is useful. 

Remember this is a living document that is expected to be changed as you make progress on your project.
